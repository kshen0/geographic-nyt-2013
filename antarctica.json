Born during World War I to Joseph and Anna Straus, he grew up in Newark, New Jersey, attending Hawthorne Avenue School and South Side High School. He graduated from Stevens Institute of Technology with a degree in Mechanical Engineering and later joined the construction firm J. M. Straus & Co., which his father had formed in 1910 after emigrating from a small village in the Russian Pale. Working side by side, Howard and his father expanded the business from home-building and store renovations into larger construction projects undertaken throughout New Jersey, with Howard taking over the business after his father's death in 1957. Numerous schools, post offices, synagogues, factories, office buildings, apartment buildings and community facilities continue to attest to the integrity and skill of his work. In 1946 he met Helaine Nelkin of Maplewood, New Jersey on a blind date not long after her graduation from Skidmore College and they were married soon thereafter. They enjoyed 55 years of life together before her passing in 2002. With their base in South Orange, New Jersey, they alternated seasons between there and their homes in Delray Beach, Florida and Vail, Colorado. Avid golfers, tennis players and skiers, they enjoyed an active, varied and full life, Howard himself only giving up skiing at age 88 after breaking three ribs. They travelled widely with family and friends, visiting dozens of countries and (if one includes a purposeful flight over Antarctica) all six Continents, as well as the Seven Seas. Nor did they cease their interest in learning, pursuing graduate studies in later life, with Helaine earning a Master of Arts degree from NYU in 1980 and Howard a Master of Science degree in 1979 from his alma mater Stevens. Together they raised three boys, Michael, Larry and Bill, who mourn their loss and will always hold dear their parents' memories. In addition to his sons, Howard leaves their devoted wives Philippa, Lesley and Kerry; his five adored grandchildren Philippa, Marc, Lanham, Katherine and Andrew; Lanham's wife Amanda and their children, the blessing of his two great-grandchildren Chelsea and Preston; his beloved brother Norman; his beloved sister-in-law Jane Levine; his beloved nieces and nephews Elliot, Cyndi, Martin and Wendy; his beloved companion of many years Ronnie Armuth; his generous caregivers Zorelis, Maria, Heidi and Sula, who provided him with great peace and comfort in his last months and days; as well as his cousins and other members of his extended family; all of whom will miss him greatly. Services will be held at Bernheim Apter Kreitzman Suburban Funeral Chapel, 68 Old Short Hills Rd, Livingston, NJ, on Sunday, January 12, 2013, at 1pm.
